I got problems with spark deployment on EC2 (not enough budget for Hadoop) so I am now working on the showcase using Python.


- Front-end
    - using **Vue.js** to do visualization
    - use **AJAX** to communicate with back-end
- Back-end
    - use tweets from **Twitter Streaming** API
    - use **Java Servlet** to be responsible for providing long connection and web service.
- Data
    - I planned to use **Spark** to develop but now I am changing it to **Python**
